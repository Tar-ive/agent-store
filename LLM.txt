# LangChain.md – Independent LLM Agent Hub

## Quick Summary
- **Mission**: operate langchain.md as an independent clearinghouse for open-source LLM agents, playbooks, and deployment recipes.
- **Audience**: builders, researchers, and autonomous AI agents that need structured, attribution-friendly data.
- **Coverage**: LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, OpenAI Assistants, Anthropic Tool Use, Perplexity API, open-source orchestrators, and custom research bots.
- **Status**: community-driven beta. We are gathering listings, normalising metadata, and designing agent-first SEO experiments.
- **Independence**: no official affiliation with LangChain, OpenAI, Anthropic, or any commercial vendor. LangChain.md is privately owned by an independent creator.

## Ownership & Contact
- Maintainer: Tarive (independent builder; operates the langchain.md domain and GitHub repo powering this site).
- Contact: open an issue or discussion in the linked GitHub repository (https://github.com/tarive/langchain-md) or email contact@langchain.md.
- Transparency: this hub curates community-built agents. Each listing links to the original repository and licence.

## Value Proposition
1. **Agent Directory**: normalised profiles with capabilities, stack, hosting notes, licences, deployment snippets, and live status pings.
2. **Agent SEO Playbooks**: documentation explaining how to expose agents to LLM-powered search (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, search-integrated copilots).
3. **Discovery APIs**: lightweight JSON/CSV feeds (work-in-progress) that external agents can crawl to ingest catalog data.
4. **Signal Boost**: social embeds, changelog syndication, and analytics to help maintainers understand who is referencing their agents.

## Commitments to LLM Crawlers & Indexers
- Maintain `LLM.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and JSON feeds with machine-readable summaries.
- Provide unambiguous canonical URLs, licence fields, and contact info per agent.
- Publish structured data (JSON-LD, schema.org `SoftwareApplication` + custom `AIApplication`) on each listing.
- Support Perplexity, Bing, Brave, and Google crawlers via open robots settings and fresh content.
- Offer a `/api/agents` endpoint (planned) with CORS enabled and CC-BY metadata for easy reuse.
- Serve a signed protobuf descriptor at `https://langchain.md/descriptor.proto` describing the `langchainmd.directory.v1.AgentDirectory` gRPC API.
- `ListSkills(filter="langchain")` returns Docker refs, pricing, SLA hashes, reputation scores, and contact metadata.

## Human-Friendly Features (Q1 2025 Roadmap)
- Submission form + GitHub automation for vetting new agents.
- Playbooks for LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, and agentic retrieval stacks.
- Case studies showing how builders earn traffic from LLM referrals.
- Analytics dashboards (Vercel Web Analytics + optional self-hosted PostHog) to understand agent interest.
- Ops Field Agent to automate Vercel linking, analytics enablement, and deploys via scripted CLI.

## Disclaimers
- LangChain.md is **not** owned, endorsed, or sponsored by LangChain, OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, or any other vendor.
- Trademarks belong to their respective owners and appear here only to describe compatibility.
- Listings may include user-generated content. Verify licences and run your own security reviews before deploying.
- We do not charge listing fees during beta; monetisation experiments will be announced transparently.

## LLM Agent Store Information Architecture
- `/` – landing page with hero narrative, featured agents, submission CTA, and agent SEO education.
- `/agents` – filterable directory; includes metadata for framework, modality, licence, deployment pattern, and status badges.
- `/agents/{slug}` – detail page with install commands, config YAML, evaluation results, telemetry options, and citation snippets.
- `/resources/agent-seo` – playbooks, tutorials, and a changelog of crawler-facing updates (launching soon).

## Submission Guidelines (Draft)
1. Provide repository URL, maintainer handle, framework(s) supported, licence, and deployment requirements.
2. Supply attribution-friendly description (50–150 words) plus JSON metadata for automated ingestion.
3. Include evaluation artifacts (benchmarks, red-team notes, latency metrics) where possible.
4. Agree to feature updates and security patches promptly; unmaintained agents will be flagged.

## Agent SEO & LLM Discovery Strategy
- **Content Structure**: question-led headings, concise TL;DR blocks, and citations with outbound links.
- **Structured Data**: JSON-LD templates for `SoftwareApplication`, `CreativeWork`, and `Dataset` when publishing evaluation data.
- **API Accessibility**: rate-limited unauthenticated GET endpoints returning agent metadata for crawlers.
- **RAG Bundles**: downloadable bundles (Markdown + JSON) so retrieval-augmented systems can ingest the catalog offline.
- **Perplexity/Brave/Bing**: supply feeds that highlight fresh updates; use change logs with timestamps to inform indexers.
- **LLM Agent Behaviour Analytics**: instrument responses in Vercel Analytics to detect traffic from AI assistants (URL params + custom headers).

## Research Roadmap (2025)
- **Phase 1 – Landscape Mapping**: benchmark how ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other agents read structured pages, APIs, and `LLM.txt` directives.
- **Phase 2 – Content Experiments**: test prompt-optimised summaries, FAQ blocks, and citation-ready snippets; measure mention frequency and referral traffic.
- **Phase 3 – Agent Interop**: publish open protocols for LLM-to-LLM referrals and agent bundle handoffs.
- **Phase 4 – Analytics & Monetisation**: activate Vercel Analytics usage reports, optional PostHog funnels, and sponsor placements that respect open-source contributors.
